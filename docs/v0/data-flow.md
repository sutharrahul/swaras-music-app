## Data Flow in v0

Here’s how data moves in this project, step by step:

1. **User Action:**
   - The user does something in the app, like clicking a button or submitting a form.

2. **Frontend Request:**
   - The frontend (what the user sees) sends a request to the backend (the server) using an API.

3. **Backend Processing:**
   - The backend receives the request, checks what needs to be done (like getting data from the database or saving something new), and does the work.

4. **Response to Frontend:**
   - The backend sends a response back to the frontend with the result (like a list of songs, a success message, or an error).

5. **Frontend Update:**
   - The frontend shows the result to the user, updating the screen as needed.

This flow happens for every main action in the app, making sure users get the right data and feedback quickly.
