## Main Decisions in v0

Here are the main decisions I made while building v0:

---

### 1. Using Next.js and React for Frontend

- **What choice I made:** I chose Next.js with React to build the frontend.
- **Why I chose it:** It’s popular, has good documentation, and makes building UIs easier for beginners.
- **What I did not choose:** I did not use Angular or Vue because I was more comfortable with React.
- **What I learned:** Next.js helps with routing and server-side rendering, which makes the app faster and easier to manage.

### 2. REST API for Communication

- **What choice I made:** I used REST APIs for frontend-backend communication.
- **Why I chose it:** REST is simple to understand and easy to set up for basic projects.
- **What I did not choose:** I did not use GraphQL because it seemed more complex for my first version.
- **What I learned:** REST is good for simple data flows, but GraphQL might be better for more complex needs later.

### 3. Basic Authentication System

- **What choice I made:** I implemented email/password authentication and verification.
- **Why I chose it:** It’s a standard way to keep user accounts secure and is easy to explain.
- **What I did not choose:** I did not add OAuth or social logins yet.
- **What I learned:** Email verification adds a layer of security, but more options could help users in the future.

### 4. Simple UI Design

- **What choice I made:** I kept the UI clean and basic.
- **Why I chose it:** I wanted to focus on functionality first and not get stuck on design.
- **What I did not choose:** I did not use advanced UI libraries or custom themes.
- **What I learned:** Simple UIs are easier to build and test, but better design can improve user experience.

### 5. Storing Data in a Database

- **What choice I made:** I used a database to store users, playlists, and songs.
- **Why I chose it:** Databases are reliable for saving and retrieving data.
- **What I did not choose:** I did not use local storage or files for main data.
- **What I learned:** Databases make it easier to scale and manage data as the app grows.

These decisions helped me learn about building real apps, making choices, and understanding trade-offs. I know there’s more to learn and improve as I keep building.
