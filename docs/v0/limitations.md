## Limitations of v0

Here are some current limitations and areas to improve:

### Missing Features
- No search for songs or playlists yet
- No user profile editing
- No social features (like sharing playlists)
- No mobile app version

### Not Optimized Yet
- Song upload and streaming can be faster
- UI is basic and could look better
- Error messages are simple, not detailed
- Security can be improved (like better password rules)

### What I Want to Improve Later
- Add search and filter options
- Make the UI more modern and responsive
- Add more admin controls
- Improve performance for large playlists
- Add notifications and real-time updates

I am still learning and improving. These limitations show where I can grow and what I want to build next.
